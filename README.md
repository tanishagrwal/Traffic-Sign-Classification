# Traffic-Sign-Classification
# Summary
In this project, we will use Convolutional Neural Network to build train and test a traffic sign classification model. We will build this model using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. This model can be used to make smarter cars.
# Conclusion
Started with downloading the dataset, preprocessing it, created the model and found out the predictions using the model. During preprocessing we found that this dataset has 43 classes. Model reached an accuracy of 95%+ in just 50 epochs, we can further optimize the model using hyper parameter tuning and reach a higher accuracy.
# Scope
This model can be used in self driving cars which will enable them to automatically recognize traffic signs similarly the driver alert system inside cars will help and protect drivers by understanding the traffic signs around them.
